READ THIS FIRST!!!
This is a work in progress. This “release” is a sort of beta version, although there is practically noting to do except move around one cave, kill a few orcs and fungus, collect gold and potions.

Please send any suggestions or bug reports to arthurabouvier@outlook.com

Also, I have no idea if this game counts as copyright infringement. If it is, please tell me. This is my first ever “released” game.



Introduction:
Welcome to Rogue+! You are a rogue, bravely venturing dangerous dungeons in search of treasure.

Requirements:
I think all you need is the latest version of Java: https://java.com/en/

How to Play:
Open “rogue_plus.jar” to start.

Screen:
Stats are shown at the bottom of the screen. ‘Level’ is which dungeon level you are on, for player level look at number before parentheses after ‘XP’.

Controls:
Esc - pause
Arrow keys - move/dig/attack
p - pick up items
u - use item
i - see items

Dev console:
Use ‘/‘ to bring up the console
Type a command, then press space or enter, enter a value, then press space or enter again
You enter x,y values with arrow keys
Current commands are:
move - move to a new location without triggering world updates
god - toggle god mode; no value needed
hp, ask, def, level, xp, gold - set corresponding value (‘level’ corresponds to player level)
